## My Projects
### Games Poll Bot, aka Cubert
My successfully implemented pet project to create a bot for organizing surveys on board games. It fully automates the management of a group of board games, taking on the workload of one of the employees.

### Hypotension Prediction
Project to develop an algorithm for predicting intraoperative hypotension during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy. Developed as part of research work involving both clinical and software engineering aspects. Based on ultrasound and anthropometric indicators, 95% prediction accuracy was achieved.

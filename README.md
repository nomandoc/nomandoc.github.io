## About me
### Education
I was born in Belgorod, Russia. I graduated from the Medical Institute of Belgorod State University with a degree in medicine, graduating with honors. I then completed my residency at the V.A. Negovsky Research Institute of Anesthesiology and Reanimation of the Russian Academy of Sciences, specializing in anesthesiology and intensive care.
I studied programming courses at leading educational institutions in Russia: “Programming in C#” and “Programming Technologies” at Ural Federal University. 
### Hobbies
My main hobby at the moment is board games. I love games that involve a high level of communication and cooperation between players.
I love reading, mainly science fiction and horror. My favorite topics are space adventures, AI, dystopias, and Cthulhu myths.

## My Projects
### Games Poll Bot, aka Cubert
My successfully implemented pet project to create a bot for organizing surveys on board games. It fully automates the management of a group of board games, taking on the workload of one of the employees.

### Hypotension Prediction
Project to develop an algorithm for predicting intraoperative hypotension during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy. Developed as part of research work involving both clinical and software engineering aspects. Based on ultrasound and anthropometric indicators, 95% prediction accuracy was achieved.

# About
I am a software developer and an anesthesiologist-resuscitator. I effectively combine both professions by launching IT projects based on medical clinics. My experience in medicine makes me an indispensable member of the development team: I understand what the customer wants and know how to implement it most effectively. I write mainly in C, C# and Python, but I often have to use other related languages and tools.
